This educational work is provided free of charge for anyone in the world to make use of.  I didn't create it to make money, but rather because scientific education is important.  If you want to have any of it for yourself, please help yourself to it by downloading it.

This is also provided free in a second sense: you are free to use and/or modify _all_ of the material which I have written, _except_ anywhere where another author is named (e.g. attribution for the data used in the graphs), under the Creative Commons Zero (Public Domain) license (CC0).  This kind of freedom is often termed _copyleft_. You are particularly welcome to use my materials for educational purposes.
